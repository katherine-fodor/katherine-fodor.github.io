**Editing Services**

I specialise in editing journal articles for non-native English speakers in the fields of fluid dynamics, meteorology, atmospheric science and climate science. 

**Maths Tutoring**

I have previously tutored a small group of school pupils preparing for their GCSE in maths, as well as having helped undergraduate maths students with homework problems. I think the best way to learn maths is to practise solving problems that require the student to use the skill they want to learn. For that reason, my approach is to either go through problems that the student is struggling with (e.g. homework sheets, mock exam questions), or if they want to learn a specific skill, I can bring some example questions to work through.
